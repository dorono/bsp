We’ve just spent an hour in the practice room and don’t feel like we’ve accomplished anything new. Well, I can safely say that Bulletproof Saxophone Playing might be the answer. Between the enlightening interviews and brass tacks basics and technical workouts, this collection will have you thinking and growing in no time. I look forward to working on this stuff myself.<br>

I can't remember seeing anything that focused as much on just the mechanics of playing the horn. I would have to say it's a great deal to get six hours of recorded lessons for less than the price of one with a live teacher.<br>

The part of the interview with Bill Plake about breathing, for instance, is enlightening and recommended to everyone open to wisdom which varies from what's considered conventional. Same goes for the other interviews. I would recommend this book to every sax player looking for improvement, regardless of ability, as the topics and exercises include both pretty basic as well as more advanced stuff. I am using the book for myself and in my teaching every day.<br>

What makes this resource unique is that it is based on the perspectives of 6 top saxophonists, each of whom contributes their individual insights on a topic. Doron has taken these individual inputs and insightfully edited them into a clear narrative that thoroughly describes a given topic. In addition to the professionally edited text, a set of supplemental exercises is included in order to illustrate points in the text and provide a wealth of practice material. Also, the interviews with each of the six saxophonists are included, giving an opportunity to hear Doron discuss topics individually with each player. Bulletproof Saxophone Playing belongs in the library of every saxophonist!<br>

Although you can't replace good private instruction, Bulletproof Saxophone Playing comes really close. It has everything you need in one convenient place. I'll be asking all my private saxophone students to pick up this ebook. It's well written, easy to understand, and logical. I especially liked the illustrations, the format, and the little bit of humor mixed in. I listened to the audio interviews first and found the text to really reinforce the audio. Great for both visual and aural learners. A useful reference for saxophone playing with lots of great "Take Action" ideas to keep you moving forward. If you're a serious student who is open and ready to learn or a seasoned pro looking for some reminders and review, this ebook is for you. I highly recommend it! ,<br>

Using interviews, information, and exercises from some truly world-class saxophonists, Doron has developed a veritable textbook for being fundamentally sound on the sax. From breathing and embouchure, to altissimo and equipment, your bases are covered. I know the stuff in there works, because I've used much of it with my own students. I'm happy to recommend it to any saxophone player.<br>

I enjoy your writing style, and have no doubt that if you're not teaching already, you would make an awesome sax teacher. I particularly like the logical progression of the chapter sequences.You're consistent with the language that you use throughout the book, and the supporting contributions from other saxophonists really help to bring home the point that learning these foundational concepts will make the reader master of their instrument. I would recommend this e-book to friends and strangers who wanted to learn the saxophone. The compilation of the information offers a keen insight to the skills one needs to build in order to reach a level of proficiency one can be proud of.<br>

    The Bulletproof set is the best thing to come down the pike in quite a while. The interviews offer diversified, informative, creative, and enormously helpful, practical tidbits of information. All of which can be used to make us better sax players and musicians. Tricks, exercises, and especially concepts, that can be used immediately to correct and help our weak spots -- in addition to improving our "good spots."<br>

Well, after one week of practice with overtones according to the program, my wife stopped me after I started practicing and said that the entire house was vibrating! I'm going into the right direction since my sound is getting big and fat and those living in my house can confirm it! Also, I am now able to go further with the harmonics reaching the 6th from low Bb (before, hardly the 4th). In addition, I've started to study the altissimo register. Again, good results! I actually had to entirely re-work my practice room (added additional acoustic insulation), but this certifies that the program you put together, if carefully followed and applied, really works!<br>

I recently took part in an important recording session and used some of the techniques I had learned from your materials, which gave me extra ability and confidence for the session, which I am very proud of. The program was worth every penny!<br>

    I am getting a lot out of the BSP material. For a long time I have felt like I've been 'fighting' my alto - the sound has been rather flat and not too loud either. My sax tutor felt I was only getting 30% out of the instrument's potential :-( I read with some interest the section on how far the beak should be inserted in to the mouth. The change in sound / volume has been remarkable; my tutor noticed the difference straight away. It's given me the opportunity to explore dynamics more fully and improved my confidence.<br>
